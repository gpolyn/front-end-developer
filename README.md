## Welcome to my Front-End Developer Portfolio Site

To demonstrate my front-end web skills in 2017, I duplicate a [five-year-old front-end](http://www.sizemymultifamilyloan.com/api/fha_sec223f_demo) from my personal commercial real estate finance site, [sizemymultifamilyloan](http://www.sizemymultifamilyloan.com). The original front-end was completed in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) in Rails 3. As it happens, a certain Ruby gem that is critical to my original front-end tests is no longer available. The missing gem and my diminished interest in Coffeescript made it easy to embrace the challenge of duplication into 1) React.js and 2) Angular 2.
